This is how I fixed my problem,
I created a Personal Access Token from my developer settings and copied it for later step.

I added ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable by navigating to my repository settings and adding a secret. Here I pasted the previously created access token.

Then simply that code and using secrets context to access that token, note that name is similar to the one we created before

In left menu of repo settings

Now just push the code to repo and everything will work like charm :).

name: deploy-me
'on':
    - push
jobs:
    deploy-me:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
              with:
                  node-version: '14'
              env:
                  ACCESS_TOKEN: '${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}'
            - run: npm install
            - run: npm run build
            - run: |
                  cd lib
                  git config --global user.email "hi@aliasifkhan.com"
                  git config --global user.name "aliasifk"
                  git config --global credential.helper cache
                  git clone https://${{secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN}}@github.com/aliasifk/xxxxxx
                  cp index.js clonedFolder/ -f
                  cd clonedFolder
                  git add .
                  git commit -m "$(date)"
                  git push
